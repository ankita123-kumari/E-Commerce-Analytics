Diwali Sales Data Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes Diwali sales trends using Python, SQL, and data visualization techniques. The goal is to extract meaningful insights into customer purchasing behavior, seasonal trends, and product category performance.
Project Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand sales patterns.
- Use SQL queries for structured data analysis.
- Develop interactive visualizations to showcase key trends.
- Optimize data processing for efficient analysis.
Features
- Dataset: Cleaned and formatted Diwali sales transaction data.
- Jupyter Notebook: Includes EDA, data cleaning, and visualization.
- SQL Queries: Optimized for quick retrieval and analysis.
- Python Scripts: Automate data processing and analysis.
- Visualizations: Charts and graphs for product category trends, regional sales distribution, and purchase behavior.
Installation
- Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repo-link>
- Navigate to the project directory:
cd diwali-sales-analysis
- Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
